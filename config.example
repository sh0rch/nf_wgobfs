#    Example config file for NF_WGOBFS
#
# Format:
# QUEUE_NUM:DIRECTION:PORT:SECRET_KEY[:F|S][:MTU]
#
# QUEUE_NUM   - The NFQUEUE number to use (integer, e.g. 0 or 1).
# DIRECTION   - Packet direction: "in" for incoming, "out" for outgoing.
# # NAME        - Any string to identify the queue (e.g. "wg0-in", "wg0-out").
# SECRET_KEY  - Any string; it will be hashed to a 32-byte key for obfuscation.
# F|S         - (Optional) Cipher mode: F for Fast (ChaCha20, CPU optimized), S for Standard (ChaCha6).
#               Fast mode is optimized for AVX2/SIMD CPUs and is significantly faster only on processors
#               that support these instructions. If your CPU does not support AVX2/SIMD, it is recommended
#               to use Standard mode for compatibility, but both modes will work on any CPU.
#               If omitted, cipher mode is auto-detected.
# MTU         - (Optional) MTU of the external (physical) interface, NOT the WireGuard interface.
#               If omitted, the default is 1500.
#
# IMPORTANT: The cipher mode (F|S) and the secret key MUST be the same on both sides of the tunnel.
# For example, use "in:key:F" on one side and "out:key:F" on the other side.
#
# Default config location: /etc/nf_wgobfs/config
# You can override the location by setting the NF_WGOBFS_CONF environment variable.
#
# Example entries:
0:in:Test:secretkey:S:1500
1:out:Test:secretkey:S
